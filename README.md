# Nabunote

# A very simple text editor

Created using the Create Vanilla App Boilerplate : https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vanilla-js-app

It currently has a flying toolbar that can toggle bold and italic

I'll probably add a node backend to display a list of saved notes on the left hand side
